# AVL-Tree
Revisiting AVL Trees and hopefully creating a visualizer for them to help me better understand what exactly is happening.

After struggling with an AVL Tree project in my Data Structures course, I thought it would be a good idea to revisit the topic.
The goal for this project is to build an AVL tree implementation and a visualizer for it. I'm hoping that building this project will allow me to
fix some of the mistakes I made working on the school project, while also allowing me to learn some new skills, as I have never tried building
a visualizer before.
